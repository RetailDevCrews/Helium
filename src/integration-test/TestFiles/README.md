# Integration Test Files

These files can be generated by running the test file generation app in /src/test-generator

Note that the msft.json is used to test www.microsoft.com. To run the test:

- cd src/integration-test
- dotnet run -- -h https://www.microsoft.com -i TestFiles/msft.json

## TODO - insert instructions for running docker container with -e to use local volume for test files
