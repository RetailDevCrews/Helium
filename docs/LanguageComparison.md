## Additional Java-specific requirements

NOTE: azure.cosmosdb.* can be changed to the standards - I have tested - bartr

### cosmos db application.properties setup for azure-keyvault-enabled=false  

azure.cosmosdb.uri=your-cosmosdb-uri
azure.cosmosdb.key=your-cosmosdb-key
azure.cosmosdb.database=your-cosmosdb-databasename
azure.keyvault.enabled=false

### cosmos db application.properties setup for azure-keyvault-enabled=true

azure.cosmosdb.uri=[leave-it-blank]
azure.cosmosdb.key=[leave-it-blank]
azure.cosmosdb.database=[leave-it-blank]
azure.keyvault.enabled=true
azure.keyvault.uri=https://${KeyVaultName}.vault.azure.net/

### key-vault application.properties setup for azure-keyvault-enabled=true without MSI

(I think this will be removed with Azure VM solution)

### this must be removed once we get the Azure VM solution working as it's a security issue

azure.keyvault.enabled=true
azure.keyvault.uri=put-your-azure-keyvault-uri-here
azure.keyvault.client-id=put-your-azure-client-id-here
azure.keyvault.client-key=put-your-azure-client-key-here

### key-vault application.properties setup for azure-keyvault-enabled=true with MSI

### enabled must be removed once we get the Azure VM developer experience working

azure.keyvault.enabled=true
azure.keyvault.uri= https://${KeyVaultName}.vault.azure.net/
