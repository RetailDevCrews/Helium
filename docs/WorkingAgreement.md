# Helium Working Agreement

The following document is a living document, is not meant to be exhaustive nor complete and represents the principles and expected behavior. The team should feel empowered to speak up when any member violates the agreement. The agreement is signed off by everyone.

## Principle 1: Collaboration is the norm

- We will pair program as often as possible leveraging the “Helium Daily Standup” chat.

- We value Teams messages & phone over email and when possible face to face communication.

- We have an agreement on when we can expect to be able to collaborate via Teams throughout the day and the ability to jump on a quick call if needed per teammate's availability.
  - Respectful of everyone’s time zone
  - Respectful that not everyone is 100% dedicated to project
  - Team agrees if working on another project to be response via Team at least 2-3 times a day.

- We stick to our communication framework even in the most trying times.

  - Sprints are weekly and start on Fridays – Thursday (no weekend required).

  - Don’t miss project standups. Monday through Thursday at 9:30am PST/11:30 CST/12:30pm EST.

  - Sprint Planning (remote) is performed as early as possible; daily Triage following standup to ensure quick movement of issues; formal sprint planning follows Retro on Fridays at 12:00-12:30 CST.

  - Sprint Retrospectives (remote) on Friday at 11:30-12pm CST (weekly); During retros, team will have ability to provide kudos to team members.

  - Sprint Review (remote) on Friday at 11:00-11:30am CST (weekly).

  - Backlog definition and pruning should be done at least once every two weeks with Product Owner, Stakeholder and Scrum Master.

  - Any code direction changes require Design Review and team consensus before implementing; Submitter required to complete Design Review template and schedule team meeting.

- We won’t skimp on code quality or board hygiene.

  - Sprint 0 should include a user story to setup a testing framework, code coverage framework and CI/CD strategy. The requirements for unit tests & code coverage are expected when a Pull Request is done from the team.

  - Each PR will have 2 approvers (1 domain expert).

  - Leverage GitHub actions to require a successful docker build and passing tests before merging PR.

  - Once approved and validation complete, submitter and merge.

  - We will share key goals so we can help each other achieve them.

  - Refer to Kanban board best practices to ensure alignment.

## Principle 2: Encourage a Growth Mindset

- We are flexible project to project on our role, so we can learn new things.

- No question is regarded a stupid question. No put-downs or I told you so’s.

- We will make sure to intentionally spread and share expertise so that we do not rely on one person for an expertise.

- We should be able to recognize strengths and weaknesses and be honest with each other about ways to improve.

## Principle 3: Accessible and Blameless Team Culture

- We will not use blaming words.
  - Avoid: “You broke this”, “You messed up”.
  - Use: “How did this break?”, “Why did this break?”, “What steps broke it?”, “How do we prevent this?”, “How can I help?”.

- We will respect the needs of those with disabilities and consider possible accommodations they might need. Everyone can expect to have:
  - 9 hours of sleep every night
  - Chairs with backs
  - Dietary restrictions respected
  - Not being required to stand for extended periods of time

- Respect each other.

## Principle 4: Encourage and Support Work-Life Balance

- We will not work longer than 50 hours per work week with 38 hours the expected norm.

- We will not require responses to team chat or emails on vacation or outside of working hours.

- If someone is going to be unavailable during working hours, let the team know so they except delayed responses.
