# Setup CI-CD with ACR (Azure Container Registry) Task

Azure Conainer Registry has the ability to do Docker builds directly from a GitHub repository. ACR can also do this as a task that can be triggered based on a schedule, webhook or git commit.

## Create a GitHub personal access token

To trigger a task on a commit to a Git repository, ACR Tasks need a personal access token (PAT) to access the repository. If you do not already have a PAT, follow these steps to generate one in GitHub:

1. Navigate to the PAT creation page on GitHub at <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>

2. Enter a short description for the token, for example, "ACR Tasks Demo"

3. Select scopes for ACR to access the repo. To access a public repo as in this tutorial, under repo, enable repo:status and public_repo

   >Note: To generate a PAT to access a private repo, select the scope for full repo control.

4. Select the Generate token button (you may be asked to confirm your password)

5. Copy and save the generated token in a secure location (you use this token when you define a task in the following section)

## Create the build task

Fork the repository you want to work with. This example is using the <https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium-csharp> repository.

Once you have forkedthe repository then clone it to your local system

```shell
git clone http://github.com/gituser/helium-chsarp
```

Now that you've completed the steps required to enable ACR Tasks to read commit status and create webhooks in a repository, you can create a task that triggers a container image build on commits to the repo.

First, populate these shell environment variables with values appropriate for your environment. This step isn't strictly required, but makes executing the multiline Azure CLI commands in this tutorial a bit easier. If you don't populate these environment variables, you must manually replace each value wherever it appears in the example commands.

```shell
ACR_NAME=<registry-name>        # The name of your Azure container registry
GIT_USER=<github-username>      # Your GitHub user account name
GIT_PAT=<personal-access-token> # The PAT you generated in the previous section
REPO_NAME=<repo to be built>    # The Repository that has the source code and Dockerfile to build the image
```

Now, create the task by executing the following az acr task create command:

```shell
az acr task create \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --name $REPO_NAME-build \
    --image $REPO_NAME \
    --context https://github.com/$GIT_USER/$REPO_NAME.git \
    --file Dockerfile \
    --git-access-token $GIT_PAT
 ```

This task specifies that any time code is committed to the master branch in the repository specified by --context, ACR Tasks will build the container image from the code in that branch. The Dockerfile specified by --file from the repository root is used to build the image. The --image argument can specify a parameterized value of {{.Run.ID}} for the version portion of the image's tag, ensuring the built image correlates to a specific build, and is tagged uniquely. This must be reflected correctly where the image is being pulled from.

Output from a successful az acr task create command is similar to the following:

```console
{
  "agentConfiguration": {
    "cpu": 2
  },
  "creationDate": "2018-09-14T22:42:32.972298+00:00",

        "sourceRepository": {
          "branch": "master",

          "sourceControlAuthProperties": null,
          "sourceControlType": "GitHub"
        },
        "sourceTriggerEvents": [
          "commit"
        ],
        "status": "Enabled"
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/tasks"
}
```

## Test the build task

You now have a task that defines your build. To test the build pipeline, trigger a build manually by executing the az acr task run command:

```shell
az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name helium-csharp-build
```

By default, the az acr task run command streams the log output to your console when you execute the command.

```shell
az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name helium-csharp-build

Trigger a build with a commit

Now that you've tested the task by manually running it, trigger it automatically with a source code change.

First, ensure you're in the directory containing your local clone of the repository. Make a small change that is inconsequential to the your local copy of the clones repository and then commit the change back to origin. AS an example add a blank line to the appsettings.json of the helium-csharp src code

```shell
git add appsettings.json
git commit -m "Testing CI"
git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': <github-username>
Password for 'https://githubuser@github.com': <personal-access-token>
```

Once you've pushed a commit to your repository, the webhook created by ACR Tasks fires and kicks off a build in Azure Container Registry. Display the logs for the currently running task to verify and monitor the build progress:

```shell
az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
```

Output is similar to the following, showing the currently executing (or last-executed) task:

```shell
az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
Showing logs of the last created run.
Run ID: da4

[...]

Run ID: da4 was successful after 38s
```

List builds
To see a list of the task runs that ACR Tasks has completed for your registry, run the az acr task list-runs command:

```shell
az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
```

Output from the command should appear similar to the following. The runs that ACR Tasks has executed are displayed, and "Git Commit" appears in the TRIGGER column for the most recent task:

```shell
az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
